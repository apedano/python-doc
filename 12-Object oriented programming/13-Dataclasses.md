# 13-Dataclasses

`Dataclasses` are python classes, but are suited for storing data objects. 
This module provides a decorator and functions for automatically adding generated special methods such as `__init__()` and `__repr__()` to user-defined classes.

**It resables the @Data annotation in Lombok**
