## What is a Python package

> A Python package is a collection of Python modules that can be easily distributed and installed. 
> It allows developers to reuse code across multiple projects and share it with others.

You might have used built-in Python packages such as `os`, `sys`, or `math`, or external dependencies 
such as `requests`, `pandas`, or `numpy` in your Python projects.

## What is Poetry

> Poetry is a modern tool for package management in Python that simplifies the process of creating,
> managing, and publishing Python packages.

It provides an **easy-to-use command-line interface for managing dependencies, building packages, and publishing them to PyPI (Python Package Index)**, the official repository of Python packages.

There are several benefits of using Poetry for package management in Python:

* **Dependency resolution**: It automatically manages dependencies and ensures that your package is compatible with other packages in your project.
* **Virtual environments**: It creates a virtual environment for your project, which allows you to isolate your package and its dependencies from the rest of your system.
* **Project scaffolding**: It provides a simple command-line interface for creating new Python projects and setting up their basic structure.
* **Built-in building and packaging**: It provides tools for creating distributable packages in a variety of formats, including source distributions, wheel distributions, and binary distributions.
* **Publishing to PyPI**: It makes it easy to publish your package to PyPI, allowing other developers to easily install and use your package.

* Overall, Poetry provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing dependencies, building packages, and publishing them to PyPI. If you're working on a Python project that requires package management, Poetry is definitely worth checking out.
